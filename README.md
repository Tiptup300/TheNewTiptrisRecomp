# TheNewT64trisRecomp

A work-in-progress native PC port of **The New Tiptris** — an N64 game by H2O —
built with [N64: Recompiled](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp): static
recompilation of the game's MIPS code to C, run on a modern runtime + renderer.

> ### ⚠️ No game data is included in this repository
> This repo contains the port harness plus the **recompiled program code** — a
> machine translation of the game's MIPS code to C, which is what every
> N64Recomp port (Banjo/Zelda) ships. It contains **no ROM and no game data**
> (graphics, audio, level data) and **no rendered game imagery**. The game data
> is read from **your own legally-obtained ROM at runtime**: on first launch the
> app asks for your ROM, stores a local copy, and reuses it on every run after.
> You must supply the ROM yourself. `.gitignore` keeps ROMs and game data out.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/` | The port harness (app entry, overlay registration, callbacks, RSP/audio wiring) |
| `CMakeLists.txt`, `executable.cmake` | Build definition (RT64 + N64ModernRuntime + RecompFrontend + the recompiled output) |
| `tnt.us.toml` | N64Recomp config for the game code (section layout + entrypoint; **no game data**) |
| `n_aspMain.us.toml` | RSPRecomp config for the audio microcode (offsets + the audio-command jump table) |
| `gen_syms.py` | Generates the N64Recomp symbols file from the `tnt-splat` decompilation |
| `patches/ui_funcs.h` | Minimal UI-API glue required by RecompFrontend |
| `assets/` | Open-source UI fonts (Ubuntu, Noto Emoji) + a minimal RmlUi stylesheet |
| `RecompiledFuncs/` | The recompiled game code, grouped by `<domain>/<subsystem>.c` |
| `tools/` | RE/build tooling — see *Improving the game source code* below |

## Status

- ✅ Boots, renders (RT64), full keyboard/controller input, all menus & gameplay
- ✅ Music/SFX play (audio microcode recompiled) — delivery still being polished
- Target ROM: the (U) release — sha1 `83fff25e82181a6993f28c91b9eeb8430396838b`, crc32 `528a07fa`

## Download & play

Grab the latest Linux build from the [Releases](../../releases) page, then:
```bash
tar xzf TheNewTiptris-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd TheNewTiptris
./TheNewTiptris
```
On first launch it asks for your ROM (the (U) release above). It stores a local
copy in your config dir and reuses it automatically on every later run — no game
data is bundled. If the file picker doesn't work on your desktop, you can point
it at the ROM directly once: `TNT_ROM=/path/to/rom.n64 ./TheNewTiptris`.

Needs a Vulkan-capable GPU (any modern Mesa/RADV/NVIDIA driver). Tested on CachyOS.

## Build from source

### 1. Prerequisites (Ubuntu/WSL2)
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y cmake ninja-build clang lld llvm libsdl2-dev libgtk-3-dev \
    libfreetype-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev binutils-mips-linux-gnu python3-venv
```

### 2. Dependencies (external — cloned, not committed)
```bash
mkdir -p lib && cd lib
# Pin to these commits (mutually compatible):
git clone https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64ModernRuntime && (cd N64ModernRuntime && git checkout ca568b6 && git submodule update --init --recursive)
git clone https://github.com/rt64/rt64                   && (cd rt64            && git checkout f0d8c9f && git submodule update --init --recursive)
git clone https://github.com/N64Recomp/RecompFrontend    && (cd RecompFrontend  && git checkout b3b7ebb && git submodule update --init --recursive)
cd ..
```
Also build the N64Recomp tools (`N64Recomp`, `RSPRecomp`) from
[N64Recomp](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp).

Then apply our required dependency fixes (controller detection, keyboard mapping,
SDL2 audio buffering) — small patches kept in this repo:
```bash
./patches/deps/apply.sh
```
See `patches/deps/apply.sh` for what each patch does and why.

### 3. (Optional) Regenerate the recompiled code from *your* ROM
The recompiled program code is already committed (`RecompiledFuncs/`,
`rsp/n_aspMain.cpp`, `tnt.syms.toml`), so a normal build does **not** need the
ROM or the recompiler tools. You only need this to reproduce the recompilation
from scratch (place your ROM where the configs expect it — `tnt-splat/baserom.z64`):
```bash
# a) Symbols: from the chris-gilmore/tnt-splat decompilation (matches this ROM).
#    Run its `splat split` on an all-asm variant, then:
python3 gen_syms.py            # -> tnt.syms.toml
# b) Recompiled game code (needs the N64Recomp tool + ROM):
N64Recomp tnt.us.toml                    # -> flat RecompiledFuncs/funcs_*.c
python3 tools/reorganize_recompiled.py   # fold into the <domain>/<subsystem>.c hierarchy
# c) Recompiled audio microcode (needs the RSPRecomp tool + ROM):
RSPRecomp n_aspMain.us.toml    # -> rsp/n_aspMain.cpp
```

### 4. Build
```bash
cmake -S . -B build-cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-cmake -j
```
Run `build-cmake/TntRecompiled` and point the launcher at your ROM.

## Improving the game source code

The recompiled game code lives in `RecompiledFuncs/`, organized by domain and
subsystem (`core/`, `gameplay/`, `graphics/`, `audio/`, `ai/`, `modes/`,
`system/`). Most gameplay/graphics/audio functions carry meaningful names; the
rest are address placeholders (`func_8006xxxx`) — mostly the `system/` library
and `frametime` residue.

**Source of truth.** `tnt.syms.toml` is canonical — the function names,
boundaries, and (via name prefixes) the file organization all derive from it.
`tnt-splat` was a one-time bootstrap (its disassembly seeded `tnt.syms.toml` via
`gen_syms.py`); it is **not** a live dependency.

**What you can do:** rename functions (convention: `Subsystem_PascalCaseVerb`;
math uses `vecN_op`), regroup them into subsystem/domain files, and add comments —
all by editing `tnt.syms.toml`.
**What you can't:** rewrite the function *bodies* — they are mechanical
register-level MIPS-in-C (`ctx->r14 = MEM_H(ctx->r5, 0x4)`). Making the logic
itself readable is full decompilation, a separate and far larger effort.

**Workflow.** Edit a name in `tnt.syms.toml` → regenerate the flat `.c` with
N64Recomp (needs the ROM) → `python3 tools/reorganize_recompiled.py` to fold the
output back into the `<domain>/<subsystem>.c` hierarchy. A rename propagates
consistently to `funcs.h`, `lookup.cpp`, `recomp_overlays.inl`, and the body. (A
rename can also be applied without the ROM as a whole-word token substitution
across those generated files + `tnt.syms.toml`; a later regen reproduces it.)

**Tools** (in `tools/`):
- `verify.sh` — one-command green/red build+link check; the definitive test for a
  rename or reorg (no GPU needed). `--boot` adds a Dozen runtime smoke test.
- `callgraph.py <fn> [--callers|--callees -d N]` — a function's callers/callees and
  a call tree; the best way to map a subsystem before naming it.
- `complexity.py` — rank functions by cyclomatic complexity (writes `FUNCTION_COMPLEXITY.md`).
- `coverage.py [--domains]` — per-subsystem / per-domain naming progress.
- `reorganize_recompiled.py` — re-bucket functions into the domain hierarchy
  (rerun after regenerating, or after renames that change a function's prefix).

Run `./tools/verify.sh` after every change and commit in small batches.
